    <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>I authorize The Lash®Salon Professional to perform the
        semi-permanent eyelash extension procedure. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>- I understand this procedure requires individual synthetic
        eyelashes to adhere to my own natural lashes.  - I understand that it is my
        responsibility to remain still during the application and to keep my eyes
        closed during the entire process until otherwise advised. I have been fully
        informed as to the methods and procedures concerning the semi-permanent eyelash
        extension application. The known risk is of the cosmetic procedure I have
        chosen have been disclosed to me. Some cases may result in complications, such
        as transient eye redness and irritation and allergic reaction to the adhesive,
        under-eye gel patches or any other products used. If at any time I am
        uncomfortable with the eyelash extension procedure, I will inform the stylist
        and s/he will gladly rectify the problem, including ending the session if I (or
        the stylist) wish. If the stylist is uncomfortable applying lashes to me, s/he
        will discuss his/her concerns with me and may end the session if necessary. It
        has been represented to me that no guarantees, warranties, promises,
        commitments or other statements as to the results of this service have been
        made, and I acknowledge that I have received no particular representations or
        guarantees, and I am consenting to the procedure at my own risk. </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>I have revealed or disclosed on the Client Registration
        &amp; History Form and the Client Consultation &amp; Design Form all conditions
        and circumstances regarding my health and health history, medications being
        taken, and any past reactions to products used or medications taken. Additional
        conditions may occur or be discovered during or after the procedure, which
        could affect my ability to tolerate the procedure.  I understand the longevity
        of my eyelash extensions requires careful maintenance. I understand basic makeup
        application and a normal lifestyle can resume after the application. However,
        during the first 6 hours after the application, I should avoid replacing
        contact lenses, water, liquids, steam, excessive heat, and cosmetics (skincare,
        mascara, etc.) for extended longevity and flexibility of my eyelash extensions.
        I also understand that even after the first 6 hours, I need to avoid the
        following activities: excessive swimming, sauna, steam rooms, pulling on
        lashes, using oil-based, or waterproof cosmetics. Using mechanical curlers or
        crimping lashes in any way is not recommended while wearing eyelash
        extensions.  I, as herein signed, release, give up, acquit, and discharge my
        The Lash®Salon Professional or anyone affiliated with my The Lash®Salon
        Professional including any partnership, corporations, or company associated
        with said individual from any claims or damages of any nature. I agree to pay
        any costs of legal services necessary to further effect or confirm the said
        release.  I further agree that this release shall be in contemplation of any
        possible damages, either known or unknown at the signing of this Waiver and
        Release Form and said damages are specifically waived following the signing of
        this waiver and release form. I further agree that in the event any litigation
        ensues, it shall be placed before the American Arbitration Association for
        resolution.  </p>

    <p class=MsoNormal>I agree that in the event a decision is determined in favor
        of one party over the other, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
        reasonable attorney fees and costs as set by the arbitrator. I further agree to
        hold my The Lash®Salon nameless and harmless form any and all damages. I
        release The Lash®Salon form any responsibility for pre-existing conditions I
        have not revealed or any consequential change to those conditions that arise
        subsequent to the procedure. I understand that I am responsible for any medical
        treatment I may need to receive as a result of getting this procedure. I accept
        full responsibility for these and any other complications, which may arise or
        result during or following the eyelash extension procedures, which are to be
        performed at my request.  Please read, check, sign, and date the statements
        below and on the following page to indicate that you have read, understand, and
        accept the following statement:                                      I, the
